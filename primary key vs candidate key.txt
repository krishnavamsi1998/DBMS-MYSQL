Primary Key is a set of attributes (or attribute) which uniquely identify the tuples in relation or table.

The primary key is a minimal super key, so there is one and only one primary key in any relationship. For example, 
 

Student{ID, F_name, M_name, L_name, Age} 
Here only ID can be primary key because the name, age and address can be same, but ID can’t be same. 

A candidate key is a set of attributes (or attribute) which uniquely identify the tuples in relation or table. 

As we know that Primary key is a minimal super key, so there is one and only one primary key in any relationship but there is more than one candidate key can take place.

Candidate key’s attributes can contain a NULL value which opposes to the primary key. For example, 
 

Student{ID, First_name, Last_name, Age} 
Here we can see the two candidate keys ID and {First_name, Last_name, DOB}. 

So here, there are present more than one candidate keys, which can uniquely identify a tuple in a relation. 

It is not mandatory to define a primary key, but there cannot be a relationship without the candidate key.
