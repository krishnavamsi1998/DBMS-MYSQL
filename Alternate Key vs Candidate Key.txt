There may be one or more attributes or a combination of attributes that uniquely identify each tuple in a relation.

These attributes or combinations of the attributes are called the candidate keys.

One key is chosen as the primary key from these candidate keys, and the remaining candidate key, if it exists, is termed the alternate key. 

In other words, the total number of the alternate keys is the total number of candidate keys minus the primary key.

The alternate key may or may not exist. If there is only one candidate key in a relation, it does not have an alternate key.
