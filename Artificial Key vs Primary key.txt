An artificial key is one that has no meaning to the business or organization.

Artificial keys are permitted when

1) no attribute has all the primary key properties, or

2) The primary key is large and complex.

For Example: Enrollment table from business point of view has (student, c1ass) combination as primary key. But this primary key is large and complex, so DBA decides to add row_id column as primary key. Here, row_id can also be called as Artificial Key.
