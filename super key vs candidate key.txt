 Super Key is an attribute (or set of attributes) that is used to uniquely identifies all attributes in a relation.
 
 It a super set of keys , and primary key is a minimal set of this super set

 All super keys can’t be candidate keys but the reverse is true. In relation, a number of super keys is more than a number of candidate keys. 
 
 We have a given relation R(A, B, C, D, E, F) and we shall check for super keys by following given dependencies: 
 

Functional dependencies         Super key
AB->CDEF                         YES
CD->ABEF                         YES
CB->DF                           NO
D->BC                            NO 

By Using key AB we can identify the rest of the attributes (CDEF) of the table. Similarly, Key CD. But, by using key CB we can only identify D and F, not A and E. Similarly key D. 

Candidate Key: A candidate key is a set of attributes (or attributes) that uniquely identify the tuples in relation to or table.

As we know the Primary key is a minimal super key, so there is one and only one primary key in any relationship but there is more than one candidate key that can take place.

The candidate key’s attributes can contain a NULL value which opposes to the primary key.
